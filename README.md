Code for the paper "Fairness in computational models of infectious disease epidemics"
# Abstract
Although the concept of fairness has been extensively examined within the domains of machine learning and artificial
intelligence, it remains largely underexplored in the field of computational epidemic modeling. Nevertheless, such models exert
substantial influence on public health policy, particularly in the context of outbreak preparedness and response. Here, we
propose a mathematical framework for evaluating the fairness of computational epidemic models, grounded in core principles
from social epidemiology. We begin by applying our framework to a range of epidemic modeling approaches and simulation
scenarios, including the spread of COVID-19 in New York and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak in Colombia, demonstrating its
consistent capacity to assess model fairness across diverse disease dynamics. Subsequently, we illustrate how our definition
of fairness can be incorporated into the design of immunization strategies to enhance health equity while simultaneously
improving overall effectiveness. Together, our results offer a systematic methodology for quantifying fairness in computational
epidemiology.
