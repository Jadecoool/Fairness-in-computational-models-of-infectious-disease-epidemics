## Files Description
- `SEIR_model_intervention.py` is the code for SLIRD model with additional input for simulating vaccine intervention
- `run_simu_interventinos.py` is the code for running the simulation of vaccine intervention
- `results` folder contains the simulated results under different vaccine intervention strategies with different parameters
## Running the Code
The main script for running the scenarios of vaccine intervention is `run_simu_interventinos.py`. We show an example to run the code in the script. The parameters can be changed to run different strategies and parameters.
